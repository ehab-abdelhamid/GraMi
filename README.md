GraMi
=====

GraMi is a novel framework for frequent subgraph mining in a single large  graph, GraMi outperforms existing techniques by 2 orders of magnitudes. GraMi  supports finding frequent subgraphs as well as frequent patterns, Compared to subgraphs, patterns offer a more powerful version of matching that captures  transitive interactions between graph nodes (like friend of a friend) which are very common in modern applications. Also, GraMi supports user-defined  structural and semantic constraints over the results, as well as approximate results.

REQUIREMENTS:
=====

Java JRE at least v1.6, but not past v8.

INSTALLATION:
=====

    - Uncompress grami using any compression tool
    - Set `JAVA_HOME` to point to the correct version of Java (e.g., `export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/`)
    - Build Java binaries using the "build" script file
    - Run GraMi using "grami" script

EXAMPLES:
=====

    1- Show GraMi breif help: "./grami -h"
    2- Find frequent subgraphs in the "mico" undirected graph, with minimum frequency = 14000: "./grami -f mico.lg -s 14000 -t 0 -p 0"
    3- Find frequent subgraphs in the "mico" undirected graph, with minimum frequency = 9340 and approximation: "./grami -f mico.lg -s 9340 -t 0 -p 0 -approxA 0.0002 -approxB=0"
    4- Find frequent patterns in the "citeseer" directed graph, with minimum frequency = 160 and maximum distance bound (edge weight) = 200: "./grami -f citeseer.lg -s 160 -t 1 -p 1 -d 200"
